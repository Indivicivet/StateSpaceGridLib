# StateSpaceGridLib

## Introduction

StateSpaceGridLib is a python library loosely based around replicating the
functionality of GridWare, a Java program for creating and analysing
state space grids for visualising dyadic mutuality in psychology.

The main features of StateSpaceGrid are Trajectory objects, Grid objects and
their associated styles.

Trajectory objects hold the input data as a set of lists as well as information 
about the visualisation of a single graph (line style, colour, etc.).

Grid objects hold trajectory objects and are the interface through which you
can display the graphs.

A brief test is included to display the code in action.

To install as a library with pip, use

pip install git+https://github.com/DyadicSolutions/StateSpaceGridLib

## Todos

- This readme is very out of date! Update to match current API
- Add examples to readme
- General code cleanliness
- More unit tests :)

## Library API Reference

#### Trajectory

```python
Trajectory(data_x, data_y, data_t, id)
```
Data in StateSpaceGridLib is organised via Trajectories. These objects take in data for the x axis of the grid, data for the y axis of the grid, and time data for the transitions between states (ie. the time data specifies the time at which each state starts, as well as the end time of the last state).
* `data_x`

   A list of state values for the x axis. The length of this list is expected to be the same as for the y data.

* `data_y`

   A list of state values for the y axis. The length of this list is expected to be the same as for the x data.
* `data_t`

   Time data: a list of length 1 longer than the x or y data, specifying the start time of each event in the data_x/data_y lists as well as the end point of the final event.

* `id`

   An integer id number for the Trajectory object 
```python
Trajectory.get_num_visits()
```
Return number of "visits", defined as the number of state transitions plus 1 (the initial starting state) minus the number of transitions to the same state as where the transition is from (ie. `(x1, y1) -> (x2, y2)` where `x1 = x2` and `y1 = y2`).
```python
Trajectory.get_cell_range()
```
Return number of unique cells visited.
```python
Trajectory.get_states(x_ordering, y_ordering, merge_repeated_states)
```
Return formatted state data.
* `x_ordering`

   An optional list defining the ordering of the x data scale.
   
   eg. `["low", "medium", "high"]`
* `y_ordering`

   An optional list defining the ordering of the y data scale.
   
   eg. `["low", "medium", "high"]`
* `merge_repeated_states`

   Boolean flag to control whether or not adjacent events with repeated states should be merged.
```python
Trajectory.calculate_dispersion(total_cells)
```
Return dispersion for trajectory.
* `total_cells`

   Total number of cells in the state space grid.

#### Grid
```python
Grid(trajectory_list, quantization)
```
Data now formatted as `Trajectory` objects can be collated within a `Grid` object for visualisation and the calculation of grid measures.
* `trajectory_list`
   
   A list of `Trajectory` objects containing the input data.

* `quantization`

   A GridQuantization object containing data relevant to the calculation of grid measures.
```python
Grid.draw(save_as, style, connection_style, arrow_style)
```
   Draw visualisation of state space grid.
* `save_as`

   If provided, this is the name of the png file that the image of the grid is saved as.  If left blank, the grid will be displayed in a new window using whichever gui library matplotlib has access to.
* `style`

   GridStyle object containing options for the display of the grid in MatPLotLib.
* `connection_style`

   TODO: shift to GridStyle
* `arrow_style`

   TODO: shift to GridStyle
```python
Grid.get_measures()
```
Calculate cumulative measures from all trajectories provided to the grid and return as a `GridMeasures` object.
#### GridStyle
```python
GridStyle(title="", label_font_size=14, tick_font_size=14, title_font_size=14, x_label=None, y_label=None, rotate_xlabels=False, checker_light=(220/256, 220/256, 220/256), checker_dark=(1, 1, 1))
```
Object containing visualisation customisation.
* `title`

   Grid title
* `label_font_size`

   Axis label font size
* `tick_font_size`

   Axis tick font size
* `title_font_size`

   Title font size
* `x_label`

   X axis label
* `y_label`

   Y axis label
* `rotate_xlabels`

   Rotate x axis tick labels by 90Â°.
* `checker_light`

   Colour of light squares on state space grid.
   
* `checker_dark`

   Colour of dark squares on state space grid.
#### GridQuantization
```python
GridQuantization(tick_increment_x, tick_increment_y, x_order, y_order, x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)
```
Object containing extra data relevant to grid measure calculation and visualisation.
* `tick_increment_x`
   
   TODO: rename to cell_size_x
    
   Width of a cell in the x axis. If left blank, a best guess will be calculated from the data available.
* `tick_increment_y`

   TODO: rename to cell_size_y
   
   Height of a cell in the y axis. If left blank, a best guess will be calculated from the data available.
* `x_order`

   An optional list defining the ordering of the x data scale.
   
   eg. `["low", "medium", "high"]`
* `y_order`

   eg. `["low", "medium", "high"]`

   The lowest value in the measurement scale.
* `y_max`

#### GridMeasures
```python
GridMeasures()    
```
Data container for all measure data. Individual values can be read off, or the entire thing may be printed as is.

Mean total duration of the trajectories

Mean number of visits in the trajectories.

A visit is defined as being an entrance and then an exit of a cell.

```
Mean number of different cells reached by the trajectories.
```python
GridMeasures.overall_cell_range
```
Total number of cells visited cumulatively by the trajectories. 
```python

$$\sum{\frac{P_i}{\ln(P_i)}}$$
