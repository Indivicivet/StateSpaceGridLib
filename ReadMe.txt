StateSpaceGrid is a python library loosely based around replicating the
functionality of GridWare, a Java program for creating and analysing
state space grids for visualising dyadic mutuality in psychology.

The main features of StateSpaceGrid are trajectory objects, grid objects and
their associated styles.

Trajectory objects hold the input data as a set of lists as well as information 
about the visualisation of a single graph (line style, colour, etc.).

Grid objects hold trajectory objects and are the interface through which you
can display the graphs.

A brief test is included to display the code in action.
